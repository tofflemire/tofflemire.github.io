### <a name='wocs'>Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters</a>
<img src="/local_files/NGC6791_CMD.jpg" width="200" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="25" />
As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS), I have helped continue a decades long radial-velocity (RV) survey of open clusters. With the WIYN/Hydra multi-object spectrograph, we obtain multi-epoch, high-precision (0.4 km/s) RV measurements that are used to determine cluster membership and to characterize the population of spectrscopic binaries. 

The old, metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 has fallen under my stewardship during my time in the WOCS collaboration and in 2014 we published a paper presenting our membership results and a list of velocity-variable stars that we likely binary cluster members. The main figure from this work os presented on the right where 



A follow-up paper is currently in preparation to present membership statuses for an expanded (dimmer) sample and full binary orbital solutions.
