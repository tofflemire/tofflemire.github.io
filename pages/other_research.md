#### Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters
<img src="/local_files/NGC6791_CMD.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="25" />
As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS), I help continue a decades long radial-velocity (RV) survey of open clusters. With the WIYN/Hydra multi-object spectrograph, we obtain multi-epoch, high-precision (0.4 km/s) RV measurements that are used to determine cluster membership and to characterize the population of spectrscopic binaries. 

The old, metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 has fallen under my stewardship during my time in the WOCS collaboration and in 2014 we published a paper presenting our membership results and a list of velocity-variable stars that were likely binary cluster members. The main figure from this work is presented on the right where in the top panel, a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) presents every star within a square degree of the cluster center. Field stars are presented in grey and likely cluster members from a proper-motion survey are presented in black. Points with blue diamonds around them were proposed "blue horizontal branch" stars. These were of interest because Helium-burning stars in a metal-rich cluster are presumed to fall in the Red Clump. If members, these stars would require their envelopes to have been stripped to reside in this portion of the CMD.

In the bottom panel, we include our RV membership information showing that many of the proposed blue horizontal branch stars are no longer members. Instead, we find a rich population of blue stragglers opposite the red giant branch. Consistent with previous studies of blue stragglers, we find many of them to be spectroscopic binaries, suggesting a binary mass transfer origin.

A follow-up paper is currently in preparation to present membership statuses for an expanded (dimmer) sample and full orbital solutions for binary members.

#### X-ray Spectroscopy of Recurrnet Novae
<img src="/local_files/TPyx.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" />
For my Masters Thesis, I worked with Dr. Marina Orio studying the X-ray spectra of recurrent novae during outburst. X-ray grating spectra from <i>Chandra</i> and <i>XMM-Newton</i> are capable of probing the hottest clumps of ejected material and, once they become optically thin, the hot white dwarf (WD) atmosphere itself. With two observations during the decay of the 2011 outburst of T Pyxidis, we measured the declining temperature and luminosity of the white dwarf atmosphere. The figure to the left presents the modeled WD continuum and emission lines from ejected material from our two observations. We also used the He-like triplets of O VIII and N VI as nebluar diagnostics to measure the temperature and density of the ejected material. The high densities suggested the ejecta was clumpy in nature -- the ejected mass would be enormous if it were a constant-density shell. We also found the X-ray conintuum flux to vary periodically on the orbital period, suggesting temperature inhomogeneities on the WD surface.

#### Optical and Near-Infrared Time-Series Photometry of Stellar Flares
<img src="/local_files/flares.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="25" />
As an undergrad at the University of Washington, I worked with Prof. John Wisniewski on a project at the intersection of stellar variability and exoplanet detection. The detection and characterization of exoplanets has many advantages in the infrared (IR): the star-planet brightness contast is reduced, planet emission peaks in the IR, and the emission from M dwarfs, whose habitable-zone, Earth-mass planets are most readily detectable with current capabilites, peaks in the IR. One caveat is that low-mass stars host a variety of stellar activity that can complicated the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Furthermore, the signature of these phenomena, known extensively in the optical, are not well characterized in the IR.
