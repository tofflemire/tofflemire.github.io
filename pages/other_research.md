##### Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters
<img src="/local_files/NGC6791_CMD.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="25" />
As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS), I help continue a decades long radial-velocity (RV) survey of open clusters. With the WIYN/Hydra multi-object spectrograph, we obtain multi-epoch, high-precision (0.4 km/s) RV measurements that are used to determine cluster membership and to characterize the population of spectrscopic binaries. 

The old, metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 has fallen under my stewardship during my time in the WOCS collaboration and in 2014 we published a paper presenting our membership results and a list of velocity-variable stars that were likely binary cluster members. The main figure from this work is presented on the right where in the top panel, a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) presents every star within a square degree of the cluster center. Field stars are presented in grey and likely cluster members from a proper-motion survey are presented in black. Points with blue diamonds around them were proposed "blue horizontal branch" stars. These were of interest because Helium-burning stars in a metal-rich cluster are presumed to fall in the Red Clump. If members, these stars would require their envelopes to have been stripped to reside in this portion of the CMD.

In the bottom panel, we include our RV membership information showing that many of the proposed blue horizontal branch stars are no longer members. Instead, we find a rich population of blue stragglers opposite the red giant branch. Consistent with previous studies of blue stragglers, we find many of them to be spectroscopic binaries, suggesting a binary mass transfer origin.

A follow-up paper is currently in preparation to present membership statuses for an expanded (dimmer) sample and full orbital solutions for binary members.
