### <a name='wocs'>Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters</a>
As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS), I have helped continue a decades long radial-velocity (RV) survey of open clusters. With WIYN/Hydra multi-object spectrograph, we obtain multi-epoch, high-precision (0.4 km/s) RV measurements that are used to determine cluster membership and to characterize the population of spectrscopic binaries.
