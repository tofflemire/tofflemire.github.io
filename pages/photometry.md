## Motivation
Numerical simulations of the binary-disk interaction predict that the accretion rate onto the stellar surface(s) will be modulated by the binary orbital period. Orbital dynamics influence the flows of circumbinary and circumstellar material that, depending on the binary orbital parameters, can lead to periodic enhanced accretion events. The animation below is a simulation of the binary-disk interaction for an equal-mass binary with an eccentricity of 0.5. The simulation comes <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...43M' target='blank'>Munoz & Lai 2016</a>. The color scheme present the logarithmic surface density with high densities in while and low densities in black.

In a simplistic summary, the binary orbit clears out a central gap creating a circumbinary disk and a circumstellar disk around each star. As this eccentric binary goes through its orbit, apastron passage (furthest separation of the two stars) induces a stream of material, made from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk, that brings material into the cleared gap, feeding the circumstellar disks. The figure below presents the mass accretion rate from this simulation where bursts of accretion are seen proceeding each periastron passage.

The predicted time-variable accretion is most extreme for eccentric, equal-mass binaries. The specific phase, duration, and amplitude of periodic enhanced accretion events depend sensitively on the binary orbital parameters. If the behavior depicted by these models are accurate, they carry many implications for the formation of stars and planets in the binary environment. However, conclusive observational evidence for this binary accretion paradigm has yet to be made.

## Survey of Accretion Variability in Pre-MS Binaries

To test the predictions of the binary-disk interaction, we have conducted a long-term photometric monitoring campaign capable of tracing the time-variable accretion behavior of short-period, pre-MS binaries. We have compiled a sample of nine shirt-period binaries with diverse orbital parameters allowing us to not only search for evidence of periodic enhanced accretion events but also test their orbital parameter dependence. 

With the Las Cumbres Observatory (<a href='https://lco.global/' target='blank'>LCO</a>) global telescope network, we are able to observe our binaries at candences and over time periods that previously could not have been done from a single observing site. For each binary we created a custom observing program that provided 20 observations per orbit for 10 consecuative orbital periods. Our observations were taken in broadband <i> UBVRIY </i> and narrowband H-alpha and H-beta filters. Most crutial for our work is the inclusion of <i>U</i>-band which can be used to determine the accretion rate.

At the same time, we had queue scheduled observations with the <a href='http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts/' target='blank'>SMARTS</a> 1.3m telescope taking <i>BV</i> and <i>JK</i> images for a
