Some brief descriptions of the students I have advised over the years. 

## Mikayla Wilson

Mikayla and I worked on project to characterize a heavily spotted eclipsing binary using <em>TESS</em> light curves and IGRINS spectra. Measuring the masses and radii of both stars, Mikayla found that the radii are inflated compared to standard stellar evolution models. Models including stellar magnetic fields performed the best, but still produce different ages when comparing the best fit in the mass-radius and temperature-luminosity spaces. Her work is part of a larger program seeking to understand how magnetic fields affect the internal structures of stars and our measuremnts of stellar fundamental parameters. 

This work was part of the TAURUS summer research program in 2021. The Research Note that Mikayla led can be found <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RNAAS...6..196W/abstract' target='blank'>here</a>.

Mikayla is now a graduate student in the Astronomy Department at UC Santa Cruz!
