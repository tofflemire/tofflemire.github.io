<img src="/local_files/aboutme.png" width="200" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" /> Originally from the suburbs of Portland (OR), I came to Madison by way of Seattle where I did my undergraduate work at the University of Washington.  I have been extremely fortunate to live in these amazing cities and the last few in Madison as a grad student have been great.  When I'm not doing research I try to get outside whenever possible and enjoy sailing and soccer.  I'm also in a band and enjoy playing and listening to music.  I love to travel, which being a grad student has afforeded me opportunites to do so.  Astronomy has taken me to South Africa, Sweden, Itay, and all across the US. And that's not to mention the vacation after!  It will be bitter-sweet to leave Madison and the friends I've made here but I'm looking forward to the next step!
