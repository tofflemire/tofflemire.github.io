<img src="/local_files/aboutme.png" width="200" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" /> Originally from the suburbs of Portland (OR), I came to Austin by way of Madison and Seattle before that.  I have been very fortunate to live in these amazing cities and so far Austin has not disappointed. When I'm not doing research, I try to get outside whenever possible to hike, play soccer, or hangout in a park.  In my grad school glory days I was in a <a href='http://www.thebegowatts.com/' target="blank">band</a>, but still enjoy playing and getting out to see live music.
