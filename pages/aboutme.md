<img src="/local_files/Ben_at_Calvallo.jpeg" width="400" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" /> Originally from the suburbs of Portland (OR), I came to Austin by way of Madison and Seattle.  I have been very fortunate to live in these amazing cities. Austin is a lot of fun, and has been an great place to weather the pandemic (everything is outdoors). When I'm not doing research, I try to get outside whenever possible to hike, play soccer, or hangout in a park, and I've recently gotten into bouldering.  In my grad school glory days I was in a rock band, but I still enjoy playing and getting out to see live music.
