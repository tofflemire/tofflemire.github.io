<img src="/local_files/aboutme.png" width="200" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" /> Originally from the suburbs of Portland (OR), I came to Madison by way of Seattle where I did my undergraduate work at the University of Washington.  I have been very fortunate to live in these amazing cities and the last few years as a grad student in Madison have been great.  When I'm not doing research, I try to get outside whenever possible and go sailing, play soccer, or hangout in a park.  I'm also in a <a href='http://www.thebegowatts.com/' target="blank">band</a> and enjoy playing and listening to music.  I love to travel, and life as a grad student has afforeded me many opportunites to do so.  Astronomy has taken me to South Africa, Sweden, Itay, and all across the US.  It will definitely be bitter-sweet to leave Madison and the friends I've made here, but I'm looking forward to the next step!
