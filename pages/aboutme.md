<img src="/local_files/Benjamin-Tofflemire-profile-HSF2020-177.jpg" width="400" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25" /> Originally from the suburbs of Portland (OR), I came to Austin by way of Madison and Seattle.  I have been very fortunate to live in these amazing cities, Austin has been a great place to weather the pandemic. When I'm not doing research, I try to get outside whenever possible to hike, play soccer, or hangout in a park.  In my grad school glory days I was in a band, but still enjoy playing and getting out to see live music.
