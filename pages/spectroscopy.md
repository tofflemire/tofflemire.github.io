## Motivation
Our effort to observationally characterize the binary-disk interaction with time-series, optical and near-infrared photometry (more about that <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/photometry/'>here</a>) has allowed us to make critical tests of binary accretion theory. This method, however, only provides course information such as the combined accretion rate onto both stars and the relative temperature and amount of circumstellar dust near the stars. Most importantly, these data to not supply kinematic information on the accretion streams that bridge the gap between the central binary and the circumbinary disk. 

The prediction of periodic pulsed accretion events, which our photometry supports, has become a consensus of many diffferent numerical simulations. One prediction that sets them apart, however, is which star preferentially accretes the mass of accretion streams. Some modeling efforts suggest it mass will preferentially feed the primary or secondary. Others suggest the disk itself plays a significant role in determining the primary accretor. The figure below from <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...43M' target='blank'>Munoz & Lai 2016</a> presents the accretion rate for an equal-mass binary with an eccenticity of 0.5. Each star's accretion rate is presented in the red and blue curves. The star represented with the blue curve is clearly the dominant accretor in the system, however, these author argue this has more to do with the properties of the disk than the binary.

In these simulations the circumbinary disk develops asymmetries that precess over hunderds of binary orbits.
