## Motivation

Eclpsing binary  (EB) systems enable precise measurements of stellar masses and radii with minimal model-based assumptions. For this reason they are ideal objects to benchmark models of stellar evolution. There are relatively few of these systems known at young ages (<em>t</em> < 300 Myr), and as such, there are few reliable benchmarks that are capable of constraining models of pre-main sequence evolution. For this reason, and because pre-main sequence evolution is complicated, there is significant disagreement between models and the handful of benchmarks we do have, and between different model suites themselves. 

This discrepancy highlights that there are physical processes taking place during the formative years of a star's life that we do not understand, and that current models are unable to capture. They are probbaly associated to some degree stellar magnetic fields and star spots. The impact of this short comming is far reaching too -- the precision of exoplanet measurements around young stars is limited by our understanding of the stellar host. (See my <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/thyme/'>THYME work</a> as to why we might care about young planets.)

I am working to establish an empirical mass-radius relation across the pre-main sequence using eclipsing binaries. With this work I hope to inform the next generation of stellar evolution models and provide precise relations that will imporve the accuracy of exoplanet characterization in young systems. Analyzing these systems necessarily requires confronting the effect of star spots and stellar magetism. The <em>TESS</em> mission is enabling this work by finding, essentially, every short-period eclipsing binary.

## Results: TOI 450 -- A Young EB in the Columba Association

In the first paper in this series, I have studied TOI 450, a low-mass EB in the 40 Myr Columba association. In the description below I discuss how we confirmed it was a member of Columba, how we modeled the system to include the effect of star spots, and finally, how our measurements compare to models.
