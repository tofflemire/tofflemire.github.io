## Overview

<b>I have a few primary research threads and a lot of fun side projects. Here are brief overviews to help guide your exploration of my research portfolio. </b>

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/alma/'> Planet Formation in the Binary Environment</a>

Binary star systems pose challeneges to planet formation. If the binary separation is smaller than the typical size of a protoplanetary disk, the binary orbit will dynamically truncate or disrupt the reservoir of material from which planets form. The community has found planets in binary systems of all separations, but planets in close binaries are rare. The goal of this research thread is to probe the dynamical interaction between the binary orbit and the circumstellar disks. We also hope to identify the ingredients that allow some close binaries to form planets while other do not. 

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/thyme/'> The <em>TESS</em> Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME)</a>

Planets evolve over the first billion years of their lives. This evolution imprints intriguing features on the population of mature exoplanets (e.g., the exoplanet radius valley). We are trying to find young planets as they traverse this formative era to determine the dominate physcial processes that shape their evolution. We do this by identifying transits in light curves of young stars from the <em>TESS</em> mission. We've found lots of them! I'm primarily interested in using <em>Gaia</em> to find the stellar siblings of these planetary systems. This group of stars is required to place precise ages on the systems, making them benchmarks to test planet evolution theory.

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/binary_accretion/'> Accretion in Short-Period Binary Star Systems</a>

<img src="/local_files/binary_final_zoom1_small.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25">
Accretion, the process by which an object gains mass, is a critical piece of the story of star formation. After their initial assembly, stars accrete material from a protoplanetary disk. This interaction is complex, but caries important implications for the eventual properties of the star and its planets. Short-period binaries have a completely distinct interaction in which they periodically pull material in from a circumbinary disk. Observers and theorists alike are fascinated with these systems because they represent unquie dynamical labratories where we can test (magneto-)hydrodymanic theory in an astropysical settings on human (graduate student) time scales. Observing this binary-disk interaction was the focus of my graduate dissertation.
