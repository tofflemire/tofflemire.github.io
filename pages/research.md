## Overview

<b>I have a few primary research threads and a lot of fun side projects. Here are brief overviews to help guide your exploration of my research portfolio. </b>

Accretion, the process by which an object gains mass, is a critical piece of the star formation process. After their initial assembly, stars accrete material from a protoplanetary disk. This interaction is complex, but caries important implications for the eventual properties of the star and planet. Short-period binaries have a completely distinct interaction with their protoplanetary disks. Observers and theorists alike are fascinated with these systems because they represent unquie dynamical labratories where we can test (magneto-)hydrodymanic theory in an astropysical settings on human (graduate student) time scales. Observing this binary-disk interaction was the focus of my graduate dissertation.

I've been lucky to work on many different projects during my research career. These projects have been both theory and observation based, making use of data sets spanning the X-ray to near infrared. The links below provide a brief summary of the projects I have led:

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#wocs"> Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters </a>

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#xspec"> X-ray Spectroscopy of Recurrent Novae </a>

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#flares"> Optical and Near-Infrared, Time-Series Photometry of Stellar Flares </a>

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#tsallis"> Analysis of the Column Density Distribution of Simulated MHD Turbulence </a>
