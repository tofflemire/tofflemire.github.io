## Dissertation Overview

My dissertation research focuses on understanding the interaction between young binary star systems and their circumstellar material during star formation. Over the past thirty years, a detailed picture has emerged describing the late stages of star formation, in which the interaction between a star and its protoplanetary disk plays an intergral role in the evolution of the star-disk system.
