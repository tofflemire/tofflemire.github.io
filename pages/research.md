## Overview

<b>I have a few primary research threads and a lot of fun side projects. Here are brief overviews to help guide your exploration of my research portfolio. </b>

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/alma/'> Planet Formation in the Binary Environment</a>

Binary star systems pose challeneges to planet formation. If the binary separation is smaller than the typical size of a protoplanetary disk, the binary orbit will dynamically truncate or disrupt the reservoir of material from which planets form. The community has found planets in binary systems of all separations, but planets in close binaries are rare. The goal of this research thread is to probe the dynamical interaction between the binary orbit and the circumstellar disks. We also hope to identify the ingredients that allow some close binaries to form planets while other do not. 

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/thyme/'> The <em>TESS</em> Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME)</a>

Planets evolve over the first billion years of their lives. This evolution imprints intriguing features on the population of mature exoplanets (e.g., the exoplanet radius valley). We are trying to find young planets as they traverse this formative era to determine the dominate physcial processes that shape their evolution. We do this by identifying transits in the light curves of young stars from the <em>TESS</em> mission. We've found lots of them! I'm primarily interested in using <em>Gaia</em> to find the stellar siblings of these planetary systems. Establishing this group of coeval stars is required to measure a precise age, and make these systems benchmarks to test planet evolution theory.

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/young_ebs/'> Characterizing Young Eclipsing Binaries</a>

Elcipsing binaries are our best labratories to measure the fundamental properties of stars, their mass and radii. In this thread of research I am seeking to characterizing a sample of young eclipsing binaries of various masses and ages. Filling in this sparsely populated parameter space, I hope to develop precise empirical relation that will allow for more accurate measurements of exoplanets around young stars, and to inform the next generation of theoretical models (the current ones do pretty poorly for young stars). A large component of this work is to understand the effect of star spots on our observations and how they may be biasing our measurements of young stars (and the planets around them!).

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/binary_accretion/'> Accretion in Short-Period Binary Systems</a>

<img src="/local_files/binary_final_zoom1_small.jpg" width="300" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="25">
Accretion, the process by which an object gains mass, is a critical piece of the story of star formation. After their initial assembly, stars accrete material from a protoplanetary disk. This interaction is complex, but caries important implications for the eventual properties of the star and its planets. Short-period binaries have a completely distinct interaction in which they periodically pull material in from a circumbinary disk. Observers and theorists alike are fascinated with these systems because they represent unquie dynamical labratories where we can test (magneto-)hydrodymanic theory in an astropysical settings on human (graduate student) time scales. Observing this binary-disk interaction was the focus of my Ph.D. thesis.
