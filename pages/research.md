## Overview

<b>I have a few primary research threads and a lot of fun side projects. Here are brief overviews to help guide your exploration of my research portfolio. </b>

### <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/alma/'> Planet Fomation in the Binary Environment</a>

Binary star systems pose challeneges to planet formation. If the binary separation is smaller than the typical size of a protoplanetary disk, the binary orbit will dynamically truncate or disrupt the reservoir of material that planets form from. The community has found planets in binary systems of all separations, but planets in close binaries are rare. The goal of this research thread is to probe the interaction between the binary orbit and the circumstellar disks. We also hope to identify the ingredients that allow some close binaries to form planets while other do not.

Accretion, the process by which an object gains mass, is a critical piece of the story of star formation. After their initial assembly, stars accrete material from a protoplanetary disk. This interaction is complex, but caries important implications for the eventual properties of the star and its planets. Short-period binaries have a completely distinct interaction in which they periodically pull material in from a circumbinary disk. Observers and theorists alike are fascinated with these systems because they represent unquie dynamical labratories where we can test (magneto-)hydrodymanic theory in an astropysical settings on human (graduate student) time scales. Observing this binary-disk interaction was the focus of my graduate dissertation.

I've been lucky to work on many different projects during my research career. These projects have been both theory and observation based, making use of data sets spanning the X-ray to near infrared. The links below provide a brief summary of the projects I have led:
