I've been lucky to work on many different projects during my research career. These projects range from theory to observation, using data sets spanning the X-ray to near infrared. The links below provide a brief summary of each:

Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters

X-ray Spectroscopy of Recurrnet Novae

Optical and Near-Infrared Photometry of Stellar Flares

Analysis of the Column Density Distribution of Simulated MHD Turbulence
