I've been lucky to work on many different projects during my research career. These projects range from theory to observation based, using data sets spanning the X-ray to near infrared. The links below provide a brief summary of each:

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#wocs"> Studying the Membership and Binary Populations of Open Clusters </a>

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#xspec"> X-ray Spectroscopy of Recurrnet Novae </a>

<a href="https://tofflemire.github.io/other_research#flares"> Optical and Near-Infrared Time-Series Photometry of Stellar Flares </a>
