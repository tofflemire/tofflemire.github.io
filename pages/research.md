## Dissertation Overview

My dissertation research focuses on understanding the interaction between young binary star systems and their circumstellar disks. Over the past thirty years, a detailed picture of star formation has emerged that places a heavy emphasis on the interaction between a pre-main sequence star and its protoplanetary disk. Many properties of the emergent star, the lifetime of circumstellar disks, and the formation of planets are, in part, determined by this star-disk interaction. 

Many stars, however, form with companions that have the ability to alter the distribution of disk material and the dynamics of accretion flows. Stellar companions fundamentally change the single-star-disk interaction and its implications for the evolution of the star-disk system. 

Numerical simulations of the binary-disk interaction predict that in short-period systems, orbital resonances will dynamically clear a central region of the protoplanetary disk, leaving open the possibility for three stable accretion disks: two circumstellar disks around each star and an emcompassing circumbinary disk. While orbital resonances prevent material from

I've been lucky to work on many different projects during my research career. These projects have been both theory to observation based, making use of data sets spanning the X-ray to near infrared. The links below provide a brief summary of the projects I have play a major role in:
