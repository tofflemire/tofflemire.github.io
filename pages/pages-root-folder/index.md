<hr>
I am a <a href='https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/benjamin-tofflemire-ph-d/' target="blank">51 Pegasi b</a> postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin where I work with Prof. Adam Kraus.  I received a PhD in Astronomy from UW-Madison and a B.S. in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Washington.  My research mainly focuses on observing young, low-mass stars -- determining how they interact with their circumstellar environment, measuring their masses and radii, detecting planets around them, and investigating how all of these properties are affected by stellar companions. 

[//]: # (My dissertation focuses on the late stages of binary star formation. Specifically, I study how the orbital motion of binary stars affects the distribution and dynamics of circumstellar material. More broadly, I am interested in using the intrinsic variability of accreting systems as a tool to understand the interaction between forming stars and their surrounding material. )
