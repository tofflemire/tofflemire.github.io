<hr>
I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin where I work with Prof. Adam Kraus.  I received a PhD in Astronomy from UW-Madison and a B.S. in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Washington.  My research mainly focuses on observing young, low-mass stars -- determining how they interact with their circumstellar environment, measuring their masses and radii, detecting planets around them, and investigating how all of these properties are affected by stellar companions. 

#My dissertation focuses on the late stages of binary star formation. 
#Specifically, I study how the orbital motion of binary stars affects the distribution and dynamics of circumstellar material. 
#More broadly, I am interested in using the intrinsic variability of accreting systems as a tool to understand the interaction between forming stars and their surrounding material.
