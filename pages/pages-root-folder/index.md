I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have previously received a M.S. in Astronomy from UW-Madison and a B.S. in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Washington. My dissertation focuses on the late stages of binary star formation. Specifically, I study how the orbital motion of binary stars affects the distribution, dynamics, and lifetime of the circumstellar material. More broadly, I am interested using the varaibility of accreting systems to understand the interaction between forming stars and their disks. 

I am looking forward to defending my thesis in the Spring of 2018!
