## Motivation
Short-period, pre-MS binairy stars pose a challenge to current simulations of the binary-disk interaction. Due to their small separation at periastron passage (tens of stellar radii) there exisits a close match between the inner magnetic truncation radius assumed for single stars and the outer truncation radius imposed by binary orbital dynamics. Without including the disruptive effect stellar magnetic fields have on disk material, current simulations do not accurately describe the binaries in our sample. They are, however, more representative of wider binaries.

The figure to the right illustrates the similar scales of the important dynamical and magnetic processes. The background image is a hydrodynamic simulation of binary accretion by <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...43M' target='blank'>Munoz & Lai 2016</a> for an equal-mass binary with an eccentricity of 0.5. This snap shot comes from the simulations periastron passage. If we assume DQ Tau's orbital parameters (periastron separation of ~12 stellar radii), the dashed circles mark the magnetospheric truncation radii assumed for single stars. At this scale, the entire circumstellar disk falls within a region where magnetic fields are predicted to disrupt stable disk material. This has implications on the timing of variability and the pulsed accretion events predicted by the binary-disk interaction, potentially explaining the discrepancies between these models and observations (more on that <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/photometry/'>here</a>).
