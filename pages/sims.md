## Motivation
Short-period, pre-MS binairy stars pose a challenge to current simulations of the binary-disk interaction. Due to their small separation at periastron passage (tens of stellar radii) there exisits a close match between the inner magnetic truncation radius assumed for single stars and the outer truncation radius imposed by binary orbital dynamics. Without including the disruptive effect stellar magnetic fields have on disk material, current simulations do not accurately describe the binaries in our sample. They are, however, more representative of wider binaries.

The figure to the right illustrates the similar scales of the important dynamical and magnetic processes. The background image is a hydrodynamic simulation of binary accretion by <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...43M' target='blank'>Munoz & Lai 2016</a> for an equal-mass binary with an eccentricity of 0.5.
