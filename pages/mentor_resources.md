One of my favorite parts of my job is getting to work with students. I take the responsibility of mentoring students, many of them in their first research experience, very seriously. I have invested in imporving my efficacy as a mentor and sharing resources and practices I find useful with others. Here are some resources I have found useful over the years. They are geared toward a 10-week summer research program, like an REU, but have broader applications. 

Some of these resources are adapted from the <a href='https://cimerproject.org/entering-mentoring/'>Entering Mentoring</a> cirriculum I was taught as a graduate student at UW-Madison. 

Below is a brief overview of each document. The documents are listed in the order in which they are typically used during the summer. 

There is a lot here, which might be overwhelming. I recommend starting with the Project Development Worksheet, the Mentor-Mentee Compact, and the Mentee Mid-Summer Reflection.
