## Real Art
Near the end of my PhD, I had the great pleasure to collaborate with Lydia Schweitzer, a UW-Madison art major, to create the following images. They are her renditions of the binary systems I studied for my thesis. They depict a pre-main sequence binary accreting material from a circumbinary disk. A simulation that helped inform these images can be found <a href='https://tofflemire.github.io/photometry/'>here</a>. It was an amazing experience working with her and I can't recommend the exercise of communicating your science in this way enough -- it was a blast! If you're interested in working with Lydia, you can find her contact info <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-schweitzer-73189916b'>here</a>

## Unknown Pleasures
While working on the last chapter of my thesis, I spend many months staring at time-series spectra. After making many variants on the same plot, my then office mate and plot consultant, Stephen Pardy, mentioned that my plots reminded him of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures'>Unknown Pleasures</a> album cover by Joy Division. Termed "Joy Plots", these types of visualization have become <a href='https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/joyplots.html'>popular</a> in the last decade or so for comparing distributions. So, I decided to make my own version from a Calcium line (Ca II K -- 3933.663A) obseved in the T Tauri binary TWA 3A.
